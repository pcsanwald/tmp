This is just a example project to help me figure out what is wrong with my
logback syslog configuration.

assuming mvn 3.1.1, to build, just `mvn package`, then 
`java -jar target/target/scratchpad-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

nothing appears for me in /var/log/system.log on a mac, or in /var/log/messages
in amazon linux.
